    <h1>About Ships and Stations</h1>
    <h2>This section is a work in progress as the feature set is still being refined.</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Ships and Stations</strong> is a sci-fi space adventure game in which players are members of a deep space colony abandoned by the rest of civilization after an attack by alien creatures. In an attempt to protect the homeland from the mysterious force, the portal between the two was cut off. Now, the remaining Colony Coalition struggles to maintain authority, and players are free to live life the way they see fit.
    </p>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>
      Players will begin their journey aboard a Colony Coalition station where they are brought to life as part of an initiative to grow the colony. They will choose their looks, skills, and perks, and are asked to become part of the coalition, but ultimately whether or not to do so is up to them.
    </p>

    <h2>Play Styles</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Base Building:</strong> Build expansive base stations that autonomously mine space resources and acquire wealth on their own. Build sentinel defensive forces that protect assets and receive real-world notifications when attacks occur. Use wealth to amass power and rise to the top.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Ship Building:</strong> Focus on building a ship (or ships) that outmatch all others, and use it to destroy your foes. Upgrade your engines, thrusters, shields, weapons, cargo, and more to become an unstoppable force with no spatial limitations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Players can also explore and play in other ways, such as chatting with others, casual asteroid mining, or diving into the game’s lore to uncover hidden secrets leading to fortune or misfortune.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Traversing the Game World</h2>
    <p>
      While aboard ships and stations, players roam on foot when there is artificial gravity and float through the interior when there is not. Every ship and station is explorable, and even space suits are upgradeable for better defense and maneuvering. Traveling between stations requires ships of varying sizes with maneuvering capabilities determined by upgrades. Unless stations are intentionally built together, they will always be distant enough to require light-speed based fast travel. Players will use a universal map to pinpoint coordinates and spend large sums of fuel to travel almost instantly.
    </p>

    <h2>Building Ships</h2>
    <p>
      Ships will be pre-built, ranging from small to large models with different maneuvering and battle capabilities and internal layouts. Nearly every aspect of a ship can be upgraded from its factory state. Players can also add components like storage chests, crafting stations, resource smelters, plant growing modules, weapon repair stations and much more to fit their needs.
    </p>

    <h2>Building Stations</h2>
    <p>
      Stations are 100% hand-built using a range of modules varying in size and intended functionality. Similar to ships, station interiors can be customized to fit the player's needs. Multi-level modules with elevators can be built or bought. Players can build as many stations as they wish within their assigned coordinate spaces.
    </p>

    <h2>Resources and Materials</h2>
    <p>
      Players can gather resources through manual mining, automated sentinel mining, or by raiding and looting NPCs and other players.
    </p>

    <h2>Looting</h2>
    <p>
      Any ship or station can be looted once the player gains access. Mined resources can be transferred via docking, while non-mined resources must be retrieved manually from storage locations, often requiring lock-picking skills or combat to overcome occupants.
    </p>

    <h2>Respawning</h2>
    <p>
      Players respawn with their money if it’s stored digitally in the Coalition Bank, which requires good standing with the Coalition. Physical credits remain at the location of death. Coalition members can quickly form groups to avenge raids by calling in patrol ships and other players. If the raider escapes, a bounty is placed on them for Coalition members.
    </p>

    <h2>Economy</h2>
    <p>
      The game features a dynamic economy where players can buy, sell, and trade items at fluctuating prices based on collective market activity.
